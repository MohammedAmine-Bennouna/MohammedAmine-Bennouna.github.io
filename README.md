I am currently a third year student at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique) Majoring in Applied Mathematics. Prior to joining Ecole Polytechnique, I completed two years of preparatory program (CPGE) in [Lycée Louis-le-Grand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Louis-le-Grand). You can find my [CV](MohammedAmine-Bennouna.github.io/Cv Academic Mohammed Amine Bennouna.pdf) here.    
My ambition is to pursue a PhD in Operations Research next year.


## Research Projects
* **Random minimal facotrization of an n-cycle and its connection with the theory of graphs**, (_in progress_) _Advisor: Igor Kortchemski_.

* [**Exotic barrier functions and interior point methods complexity**](MohammedAmine-Bennouna.github.io/Report - Experimental verification  log-barrier interior pointmethods are not strongly polynomial.pdf), (_in progress_) ([mid-term report](MohammedAmine-Bennouna.github.io/Report - Experimental verification  log-barrier interior pointmethods are not strongly polynomial.pdf))
_Advisors: Stéphane Gaubert & Xavier Allamigeon_.
This work is the continuity of the following [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01544).
  - Working on a counter-example of strong polynomial complexity.
  - Extending the result for new barriers.
 
* [**Simulating rare events: Hawkes process applied to Twitter**](MohammedAmine-Bennouna.github.io/SNA reaserch report.pdf). 
([Hal report ref: hal-01875943](MohammedAmine-Bennouna.github.io/SNA reaserch report.pdf)). _Advisors: Emmanuel Gobet & Martin Bompaire_.
  - Developed a Hawkes process model to describe the frequency of twitter messages.  
  - Estimated rare event probability using Importance Sampling and Monte Carlo Methods.
  - Estimated the model parameters using likelihood maximization.

* [**Traﬃc ﬂow optimization**](https://github.com/MohammedAmine-Bennouna/Traffic-opt-Aimsun) ([Github codes](https://github.com/MohammedAmine-Bennouna/Traffic-opt-Aimsun))
_Advisors: Flore Nabet & Aimsun_ 
  - Implemented a simulation-based optimization algorithm that optimizes traﬃc ﬂow by adjusting traﬃc control devices.
  - Combined approaches based on meta-models, queuing models and Aimsun traﬃc simulation



## For highschool students preparing IMO
We founded an organization Math&Maroc with previous International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) contestants to help you train for IMO, visit [www.mathemaroc.com](http://www.mathemaroc.com) for more informations.
You can in particular find courses I wrote on the publication section. [Here](http://www.mathemaroc.com/journal/MatheMarocNo3Vol12017.pdf) is one of them!


## For CPGE students
Here are some courses summaries I made that might help you: [Fiches de cours](MohammedAmine-Bennouna.github.io/Fiches de cours - Amine Bennouna.7z).
You can also find my prépa research report (TIPE) about Prince Rupert's Drop [here](MohammedAmine-Bennouna.github.io/La Goutte Du Prince Rupert - Dossier.pdf).
