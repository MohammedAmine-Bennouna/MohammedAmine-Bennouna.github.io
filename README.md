I am a first year Ph.D. student in Operations Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Prior to joining MIT, I graduated from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique) Majoring in Applied Mathematics and completed two years of preparatory program (CPGE) in [Lycée Louis-le-Grand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Louis-le-Grand). You can find my [CV](MohammedAmine-Bennouna.github.io/Cv Academic Mohammed Amine Bennouna.pdf) here.    

## Working papers
* **Feature-based PAC learning of minimal representation of an MDP from transition data**, _with D. Pachamanova, Georgia Perakis, O. Skali Lami_.
 
* **Near optimal tractable treshold policies for two-stage robust optimization problems**, (_Soon to be submitted_) _with Omar El Housni & Vineet Goyal_. 
Winner of Ecole Polytechnique's Grand Prize of research internship.

## Research Projects
* [**On random minimal factorizations of large n-cycles**](Rapport_P2.pdf) ([see](Rapport_P2.pdf)), _Advisor: Igor Kortchemski_.

* [**Complexity of interior-point algorithms: tropical compuations**](Linear_Programming_and_Tropical_Geometry.pdf),([see (Linear_Programming_and_Tropical_Geometry.pdf))
_Advisors: Stéphane Gaubert & Xavier Allamigeon_.
This work is the continuity of the following [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01544).
 
* [**Simulating rare events: Hawkes process applied to Twitter**](MohammedAmine-Bennouna.github.io/SNA reaserch report.pdf). 
([See](MohammedAmine-Bennouna.github.io/SNA reaserch report.pdf)). _Advisors: Emmanuel Gobet & Martin Bompaire_.



## For highschool students preparing IMO
We founded an organization Math&Maroc with previous International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) contestants to help you train for IMO, visit [www.mathemaroc.com](http://www.mathemaroc.com) for more informations.
You can in particular find courses I wrote on the publication section. [Here](http://www.mathemaroc.com/journal/MatheMarocNo3Vol12017.pdf) is one of them!


## For CPGE students
Here are some courses summaries I made that might help you: [Fiches de cours](MohammedAmine-Bennouna.github.io/Fiches de cours - Amine Bennouna.7z).
You can also find my prépa research report (TIPE) about Prince Rupert's Drop [here](MohammedAmine-Bennouna.github.io/La Goutte Du Prince Rupert - Dossier.pdf).
